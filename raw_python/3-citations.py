PDBe API Training
This interactive Python notebook will guide you through various ways of programmatically accessing Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) data using REST API

The REST API is a programmatic way to obtain information from the PDB and EMDB. You can access details about:

sample
experiment
models
compounds
cross-references
publications
quality
assemblies
and more...
For more information, visit http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-rest-api

# DEPENDENCIES:
# requests

"""
1) Making imports and setting variables

First, we import some packages that we will use, and set some variables.

Note: Full list of valid URLs is available from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/doc/

2) Defining request function
Let's start with defining a function that can be used to GET a single PDB entry, 
or POST a comma-separated list of PDB entries.

We will use this function to retrieve citations data for entries.

3) Investigating citations of PDB entries
In this exercise, we will try to evaluate the impact of a set of PDB entries based on the number of 
citations (publications that mention the entry, where the authors are not the same as the PDB depositors)

We will use the API call "related publications" to do this.

Let's see what the API data would look like for a specific entry.

    }

"""
As you can see, the API call returns a structured JSON object with information on three types of related publications. 
For our purposes, the most relevant citations will be found in the "cited_by" sub-dictionary. For the sake of 
this exercise, we will argue that the impact of a PDB entry is best quantified by how many times it was cited directly. 
We will also make a distinction between reviews and articles, as articles are on the frontline of science, and 
the most impactful developments are published in this type of publications.
