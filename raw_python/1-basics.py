PDBe API Training
This interactive Python notebook will guide you through various ways of programmatically accessing Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) data using REST API

The REST API is a programmatic way to obtain information from the PDB and EMDB. You can access details about:

sample
experiment
models
compounds
cross-references
publications
quality
assemblies
and more...
For more information, visit http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-rest-api
"""

# DEPENDENCIES:
# requests

"""
1) Making imports and setting variables

First, we import some packages that we will use, and set some variables.

Note: Full list of valid URLs is available from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/doc/
"""

import requests

"""
2) Basic examples
We will start with some very basic examples and operations.
"""

"""
2.1) Iterating through lists
"""

# This is a simple list with 2 PDB entry IDs
basic_pdb_list = ["1cbs", "3bow"]


# Iterating through this list (or any other lists)
# can be done with a simple function, such as:
def iterate_list(my_list):
    """
    This function will iterate through a list,
    and print each item

    :param my_list: List
    :return: None
    """
    for item in my_list:
        print(item)


# Calling the function:
print("Iterating through PDB id list")
print()
iterate_list(basic_pdb_list)

"""
2.2) Getting a specific item from a list
Getting a specific element of a list can be done using a function such as this below. 
Please note that indices start from 0 in Python, so the first element of a list has an index of 0
"""


def get_item(index, my_list):
    """
    This function will get an item from a list
    using the index of the item

    :param index: Integer
    :param my_list: List
    :return: String
    """
    return my_list[index]


# Calling the function for the first element
first = get_item(0, basic_pdb_list)
print("First PDB id: %s" % first)

# Calling the function for the second element
second = get_item(1, basic_pdb_list)
print("Second PDB id: %s" % second)

"""
2.3) Getting a value for a key from a dictionary
Dictionaries are data structures with unique keys and corresponding values.

PDBe API calls generally return data in the form of dictionaries, i.e. collections of key and value pairs

Getting values from a dictionary can be done either by directly accessing the value using the key, 
or by using a simple function, such as below.
"""

simple_dictionary = {"key": "value"}

# Getting value directly from a dictionary using its key
simple_dictionary["key"]

# Basic example of a dictionary with two keys and two
# corresponding values
basic_pdb_dictionary = {
    "pdb_id": "1cbs",
    "experimental_method": "X-ray diffraction",
}

# Getting value directly using key
print("Getting value directly: %s" % basic_pdb_dictionary["pdb_id"])


# Getting value using simple function
def get_value(key, my_dictionary):
    """
    Gets the value that corresponds to a key in a
    dictionary

    :param key: String,
    :param my_dictionary: Dict

3) Creating a mock PDBe entryÂ¶

6) Switching to real API data

First, we need a function to communicate with the API

an additional check before making the call: we will check if the PDB id in the pdb_id argument is a valid id 
that matches the PDB id pattern
